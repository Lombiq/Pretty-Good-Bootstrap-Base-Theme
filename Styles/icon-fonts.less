// Fonts should go into a separate CSS file to work around Combinator limitation, see: https://github.com/Lombiq/Combinator/issues/8
// If you don't use Combinator or don't use a separate domain for static resources then you don't need to separately
// include this LESS's CSS file, you can just import it as a LESS resource.
