# Pretty Good Bootstrap Base Theme Orchard Theme: Structure



The theme has the following project structure:

- Content
	- Boostrap: includes the whole Boostrap source
- Images
	- favicon.ico: place a file with the same name in your theme to override the favicon
- Styles: LESS files with Orchard-adapted styling and Bootsrap LESS file inclusions. All files are documented.
- Views: some minimal amount of shape templates and overrides. See the [How to...](HowTo.md) on how to use them.
