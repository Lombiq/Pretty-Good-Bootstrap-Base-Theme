# Pretty Good Bootstrap Base Theme Orchard Theme Readme



## Project Description

An Orchard base theme building on Twitter's Bootstrap framework.

We've also created a [complete sample theme](https://github.com/Lombiq/Pretty-Good-Bootstrap-Base-Theme-Sample) demonstrating what you can do with PGBBT.

PGBBT is the base for the themes of all Lombiq websites, including [Lombiq.com](http://lombiq.com/), [Orchard Dojo](http://orcharddojo.net/) and [DotNest.com](http://dotnest.com/).

The theme is also available for [DotNest](http://dotnest.com/) sites.
